---


  I am a programmer who embraces open source. In my career, I have been engaged in the development and research of embedded, virtualized cloud computing, industrial Internet and other related fields. In my spare time, I like to learn and write code, and participate in the development of some open source software, such as QEMU/KVM, spice, etc.
