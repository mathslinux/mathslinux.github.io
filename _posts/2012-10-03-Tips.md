watchpoint
==========

A "watchpoint" is a special breakpoint that stops your program when the
value of an expression changes.

watch \[-l\|-location\] EXPR
----------------------------

Set a watchpoint for an expression. GDB will break when the expression
EXPR is written into by the program and its value changes.

A simple use of this command:

``` bash
(gdb) watch foo
Hardware watchpoint 2: foo
```

The \`-location' argument tells GDB to instead watch the memory referred
to by EXPR. In this case, GDB will evaluate EXPR, take the address of
the result, and watch the memory at that address. So the following
command are equal:

``` bash
(gdb) watch -location foo
Hardware watchpoint 4: -location foo
(gdb) p &foo
$2 = (int *) 0x7fffffffdde8
(gdb) watch *0x7fffffffdde8
Hardware watchpoint 6: *0x7fffffffdde8
```

rwatch \[-l\|-location\] EXPR
-----------------------------

Set a watchpoint that will break when the value of EXPR is read by the
program.

awatch \[-l\|-location\] EXPR
-----------------------------

Set a watchpoint that will break when EXPR is either read from or
written into by the program.

info watchpoints
----------------

Prints a list of watchpoints, using the same format as \`info break'
(\*note Set Breaks::).
